# Introduction
This is a repo for storing implementations of synchronization primitives, implemented in Rust using atomic operations. 
This repository demonstrates how to build low-level concurrency primitives such as spin locks, mutexes, condition variables, and one-shot channels from scratch, with a focus on correctness and performance.
